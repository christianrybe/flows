                It’s the year 2047. Mark is the captain of Leto II - the second mission to Mars. The first expedition
                disappeared mysteriously having launched from Phobos - one of Mars satellites - to land on the Red
                Planet. Mark has lead his team from the moon with no complications and that’s what worries him most. He
                hoped he would encounter some problems that could lead him to what happened to Leto I.

                Now that he has traced their path all the way to Phobos and it’s time to leave the Red Rock he feels
                really uneasy. He should know what issues Leto I was facing, but he has seen no sign of them so far.
                He’s now ordering to launch the engines and hopes there won’t be any unforeseen complications… Leto II
                is travelling aboard a large carrier equipped with large engines. They take quite a while to launch and
                they also have an autocleaning function that preserves all the elements of the propulsion system. Both
                starting the engines and doing the auto cleaning takes quite a while and so it’s started asynchronously
                by the spacecraft driver. This is the same code that Leto I used:
