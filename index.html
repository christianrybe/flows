            <h4>Krystian Rybarczyk</h4>
`        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            I had this talk at the Codete office in Lublin last week to practice and 3 of my colleagues came. I asked
            them if they have
            any friends in Krakow so that at least as many ppl would come here but look at you. So it's a shock to see
            so many of you here. It’s very good to
            see you. I’m glad that you ppl are interested in Flows because it is a pretty cool thing. Even better:
            it is a cherry on top of a really cool thing, but first I’d like to tell you the story of Mark

                * I'll tell you the story of Mark, which hopefully is gonna be less tragic than Tony Stark from (no spoiler)
                * It’s the year 2047.
                * Mark is the captain of Leto II
                * first expedition disappeared mysteriously having launched from Phobos to land on Mars.
                * Mark has lead his team from the moon with no complications and that’s what worries him most.
                * He hoped he would encounter some problems that could lead him to what happened to Leto I.

                * Traced Leto I steps Feels uneasy when time to leave Phobos and set off to Mars
                * He should know what issues they had, but seen nothing
                * He's ordering to launch the engines and hopes for no unforeseen complications
                * Leto II is travelling on a large carrier with massive engines that take time to start
                * Autocleaning system that takes a while
                * To save time both of the above start async
                * This is the driver code that does it, same as Leto I:

                    With Kotlin coroutines we can write the code like it was ordinary sequential code. We can almost go
                    back to our first attempt and this time it is going to be correct. It's very easy to write and
                    super readable. We keep almost the same logic, but wrap it in a coroutineScope and async modifiers.

                    Concurrency in Kotlin just like the entire language is very explicit. The way it works here is that
                    we create a CoroutineScope at the very top, which wraps all the computation that we want to
                    decompose in parallel.
                    I don't want to go super deep in here, but slightly simplifying:
                    This guy has two important properties: first of all by convention each scope waits for all its
                    children to finish, so that we can reason about it in a sequential manner. And second of all scopes
                    are used to propagate cancellation to its children not to leave any hanging computation.
                    We are allowed to launch coroutines only in a Coroutine Scope. Why? Because Kotlin wants us to run
                    the concurrent computation in a well-defined context. You often want to spin off some concurrent
                    computation only in a limited time frame and then clean up. This is what Coroutine Scope is
                    essentially for.
                    It is an entity with a well-defined lifecycle which is responsible for launching and cancelling
                    children coroutines.

                    Now: what are these coroutines and where are they? Well, they're right here! You can think of
                    coroutines as lightweight threads. So lightweight in fact that you should not be afraid creating
                    them, but you're actually encouraged to create many of them to structure your concurrent logic.
                    Which I guess is kind of exemplified by how easy it is to create and use them.

                    Async is an extension method on CoroutineScope. Don't worry if you don't know what that is. It
                    basically operates on the coroutine scope we created here. async{} creates a new coroutine and
                    it returns its future result as an implementation of Deferred, which is kind of Kotlin equivalent of
                    Java Future, but better. It's scoped like we can see here and CoroutineScope handles cancellation,
                    so Deferred is fail-safe. This is one of Kotlin coroutine builders and what they also do is they
                    create their own CoroutineScope, which allows them to launch their children computation.

                    All coroutine builders and scoping functions (these special coroutine functions that we've seen)
                    create their own CoroutineScope. Let's not go too deep into the rabbit hole, but I hope you get the
                    idea.
